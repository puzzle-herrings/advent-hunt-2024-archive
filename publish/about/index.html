      <h2>What is a puzzle hunt?</h2>
      <p>A puzzle hunt is a series of a particular style of puzzles. These puzzles will not have any direct instructions, but each puzzle will have underlying patterns and structure that is up to you to figure out. This is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossword#Themes">themes in crossword puzzles</a> but applied to the entire puzzle! You may also find that such puzzles can feel similar to escape rooms. Otherwise, the design and format of these puzzles are open-ended and will vary widely. Any content in a puzzle might contain a clue to its underlying patterns. A more detailed introduction to puzzle hunts is available <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts">here</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of each puzzle in this hunt, you will get a word or short phrase that is the answer. </p>
<p>Here are some other online puzzle hunts if you're looking for examples or practice: <a href="https://crumspuzzlehunt.com/">CRUMS Puzzle Hunt</a>, <a href="https://2024.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/">Galactic Puzzle Hunt</a>, <a href="https://www.huntinality.com/">Huntinality</a>, <a href="https://ecph.site/">EC Puzzle Hunt</a>, <a href="https://puzzlepotluck.com/">Puzzle Potluck</a>, <a href="https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com/">Brown Puzzle Hunt</a>.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="content block">
      <h2>What is the format for this hunt?</h2>
      <p>This hunt is released in the form of an advent calendar, with one puzzle per day from December 1 to December 24, 2024. Some of these daily puzzles will be <strong>metapuzzles</strong> that use the content from previous puzzles.</p>
<p>The hunt has been designed to be solved in its physical form, as a printed calendar with 24 envelopes. We <del>are running</del> ran a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peppermintherrings/advent-puzzle-hunt">Kickstarter</a> to support the production of this calendar. However, all puzzles in the hunt will also be freely available here on this website! </p>
<p>Puzzle content will always be entirely contained within each puzzle's printed page(s) or PDF file. Metapuzzles will additionally use content from previous puzzles. No other information from the website will be involved in the solution of a puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>Online, each day's puzzle and answer checker will unlock at <a href="https://everytimezone.com/?t=674cf880,1">12:01 a.m. (midnight) UTC</a>.</strong> Owners of the physical calendar are encouraged to open one envelope per day as well, although we can't really stop you if you choose to skip ahead.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="content block">
      <h2>How difficult is this hunt? What is the recommended team size?</h2>
      <p>We aim for this hunt to be on the easier side—most puzzles took our test solvers between 15 minutes and 1 hour. We have released a teaser puzzle, which is roughly the length of two normal hunt puzzles.</p>
<p>There is no formal team size limit, but we recommend teams of <strong>2-3 people</strong>, or a driven and experienced solo solver.</p>
<p><strong>This hunt is not intended to be competitive, and we encourage you to collaborate with members of other registered teams if that is more fun for you</strong>. In other words, you can work with friends on some of the puzzles, but register separately to track your own progress.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="content block">
      <h2>How do we win?</h2>
      <p>This is intended to be a relaxed, non-competitive hunt. On the leaderboard, teams will be ordered by: whether they finished the hunt by solving the final puzzle, number of metapuzzles solved, number of puzzles solved. Ties will be shown in an arbitrary order. Solve time does not affect leaderboard position.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="content block">
      <h2>What happens when the hunt ends?</h2>
      <p>The final puzzle of the hunt will be released on December 24. The hunt will continue, with teams still able to submit answers and progress on the leaderboard, until December 31 at 11:59:59 p.m. UTC. At that point, answer submissions will close and the leaderboard will be frozen.</p>
<p>At some point soon after the hunt ends, we will transition to a static version of the hunt website with solutions posted. Answer confirmation will remain possible with a static answer checker, but submissions will not be associated with any team accounts.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="content block">
      <h2>Any other rules?</h2>
      <ul>
<li><strong>Don't spoil puzzles for other people!</strong> You may not stream or post solutions during the hunt publicly, or in places where other teams might unintentionally see them (But as mentioned above, you may communicate privately with members of other teams consensually.)  </li>
<li>We reserve the right to disqualify any team for unsportsmanlike conduct.</li>
</ul>
    </div>
  
    <div class="content block">
      <h2>Help, I&#x27;m stuck on a puzzle!</h2>
      <p>Here are some general puzzle tips that might be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thoroughly check the work that you’ve already done. Sometimes fixing a small mistake or incorrect assumption can make a big difference.</li>
<li>Take a break and come back to it.</li>
<li>If you're solving with others and they haven't seen the puzzle yet, get them to take a look. Fresh eyes can be helpful. </li>
<li>Consider what information you haven’t used yet. Everything on the printed page(s)/in the PDF file is fair game!</li>
<li>Try putting everything you have into your favorite search engine.</li>
<li>Look at <a href="https://devjoe.appspot.com/huntindex/index/keywords.html">similar examples</a> of the puzzle type you’re working on.</li>
<li><a href="https://beta.vero.site/try">Have you tried…</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you're still stuck, <strong>we will have canned (i.e., prewritten) hints that will be available <del>three days</del> two days after each puzzle's initial release time</strong>. You will be able to find them above the answer checker on each puzzle's webpage. Using hints does not affect your leaderboard position.</p>
<p><em>Update Dec. 3: We've sped up the hint release delay to 2 days.</em></p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="content block">
      <h2>I think there&#x27;s a mistake in this puzzle!</h2>
      <p>Please describe the error in an email to <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#97;&#99;&#116;&#64;&#97;&#100;&#118;&#101;&#110;&#116;&#104;&#117;&#110;&#116;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#99;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#97;&#99;&#116;&#64;&#97;&#100;&#118;&#101;&#110;&#116;&#104;&#117;&#110;&#116;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.

    </div>
  
    <div class="content block">
      <h2>I&#x27;m having a hard time copying content out of the PDF and into my spreadsheet.</h2>
      <p>For some puzzles, a <span>&nbsp;<i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i>&nbsp;</span> button is available that helps copy parts of the puzzle to your clipboard for transferring to a spreadsheet. This button, if present for a puzzle, will be among the buttons above the right side of the PDF viewer.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="content block">
      <h2>How do I register additional teammates to my team?</h2>
      <p>On this website, one account is one team. You do not need to do any additional registration for members of your team. For access to the puzzle pages and answer checkers, please share the login credentials among your team members.</p>
<p><strike>If your team members would like to receive hunt announcement emails, you can visit the email management page for your account to associate multiple email addresses to your team account.</strike> Registration and account access is closed. If you need help with something, please contact the organizing team.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="content block">
      <h2>What&#x27;s this about a Discord server?</h2>
      <p>We have a Discord server for the hunt! (<a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> is a popular instant messaging application.) Joining it is entirely optional! You can use it to connect with the hunt organizers or with other participants. If you're logged in, you'll see an entry for it in the top navigation bar.</p>
